 

Few things would like to mention about project

You can use login as id : markel and password : insurance to check valid login
Could have moved the database CRUD operations on another web api service and then use it in the controller to perform operations. For now made it in same project.
Example of code in webapi is in MarkelServices although currently not used. please check “ConsumeApi.doc” for some screenshots.
I have limited knowledge of web technologies and would really like to learn more. I tried to did my best but am sure I will do a lot better if given a chance to work on it. For eg, in validations of pages, once user has logged in his data can be showed, use sessions/cookies for his personal account.
Can use Logging which can write logs in a file rather than console output as of now.
