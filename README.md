 

Few things would like to mention about project

1.You can use login as id : markel and password : insurance to check valid login

2.Could have moved the database CRUD operations on another web api service and then use it in the controller to perform operations. 
Example of code in webapi is in MarkelServices folder in this project although currently not used. please check “LoginWebAPi.rtf” for some screenshots and code.

3.I have limited knowledge of web technologies and would really like to learn more. I tried to do my best by but am sure I will do a lot better if given a chance to work on it and learn with it. For eg, can improve validations of pages, once user has logged in his data can be showed, use sessions/cookies for his personal account etc.

4.Can use Logging which can write logs in a file rather than console output as of now.
